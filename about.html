            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is John Grey, a Front-end developer who also doubles up as a technical writer.
                I enjoy developing highly visible and engaging websites that clearly sowcases my talent as a fornt-end dev.
                In addition to that i make sure to always document each process so users can easily follow up on the process used.

            <h2>Goals In This Programme</h2>
            <p>My goals in this HNG internship is pretty simple and straight forward.
                Below is a list of goals I wish to achieve before the end of this program:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Efficient knowledge in Front-end development</li>
                <li>Able to land a remote Job</li>
                <li>Build connections and network with more devs</li>
            </ul>

        <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
            <h2>Areas Of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>Truth be told I still find JavaScript a bit daunting and challenging. Knowing the right function to use or how
                to set it all up is something I still find tasking. But certainly I believe this is the right platform to grown and learn.
                CSS layout also looks challenging but nothing I can't do.

            <h2>Note to Future self</h2>
            <p>Dear future me, remember how far you’ve come since building your first profile card.
                Keep learning, stay curious, and never stop building — consistency is your biggest strength.
            </p>

            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                I've learned that patience and asking questions are key in coding.
                This internship has taught me that progress doesn’t have to be fast — it just has to be consistent.
            </p>
